-- DoTInfo: what each DoT's ticks really are, learned from Blizzard's damage meter after the fight.
-- Adapted from Does It Die v0.9.1 (Joe Greive, MIT; see LICENSE-DoesItDie.txt), which does the same.
--
-- A spell's description leaves out spell power and attack power, so the tick sizes a DoT is estimated with start low;
-- they used to be corrected by reading the amount of each tick out of UNIT_COMBAT (db.ticks). WoW: Forever now hides
-- those amounts in combat, so nothing was ever learned and the "Learned tick sizes" list stayed empty. The ticks are
-- still matched by their timing and school (Core.lua), which says how many there were; what they were worth is in the
-- damage meter's per-spell total, readable once the fight is over (Core/Meter.lua). So:
--   * during the fight: Core.lua tells this file about every DoT it starts (Learn.Cast), every tick it matched without
--     an amount (Learn.HiddenTick), a cast it could not place (Learn.Untracked) and the sizes a readable tick taught
--     (Learn.Readable). The ticks are counted weighted by their shape (Agony's ticks grow);
--   * after the fight (PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED): the meter's total for a spell, less the upfront hit of its casts (the
--     description's own figure: Immolate's first hit is in the same total), over the ticks counted, is the real
--     average tick. It is blended into db.ticks, older fights counting for at most WEIGHT_CAP ticks.
-- Only where the two can match: a cast at no known mob, a cast whose DoT never showed a tick, a spell whose upfront hit
-- cannot be told, a DoT cast with Amplify Curse (the description's tick is the unbuffed one), a bleed (its hits cannot be
-- told from white swings) or one total shared by several combo point sizes teach nothing, and a size more than 2.5 times or less than half of the description's is
-- taken for a mixed-in hit and thrown away. Every decision is in the trace log ("LEARN ...").
